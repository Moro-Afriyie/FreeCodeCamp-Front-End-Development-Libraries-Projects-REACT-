## Overview

## The challenge

### Here are the User Stories I had to fulfill:

**User Story #1:** I can see a wrapper element with a corresponding id="quote-box".

**User Story #2:** Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id="text".

**User Story #3:** Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id="author".

**User Story #4:** Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable element with a corresponding id="new-quote".

**User Story #5:** Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable a element with a corresponding id="tweet-quote".

**User Story #6:** On first load, my quote machine displays a random quote in the element with id="text".

**User Story #7:** On first load, my quote machine displays the random quote's author in the element with id="author".

**User Story #8:** When the #new-quote button is clicked, my quote machine should fetch a new quote and display it in the #text element.

**User Story #9:** My quote machine should fetch the new quote's author when the #new-quote button is clicked and display it in the #author element.

**User Story #10:** I can tweet the current quote by clicking on the #tweet-quote a element. This a element should include the "twitter.com/intent/tweet" path in its href attribute to tweet the current quote.

**User Story #11:** The #quote-box wrapper element should be horizontally centered. Please run tests with browser's zoom level at 100% and page maximized.
