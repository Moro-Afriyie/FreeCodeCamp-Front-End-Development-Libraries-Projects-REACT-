## Overview

## The challenge

### Here are the User Stories I had to fulfill:

**User Story #1:** I can see a textarea element with a corresponding id="editor".

**User Story #2:** I can see an element with a corresponding id="preview".

**User Story #3:** When I enter text into the #editor element, the #preview element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.

**User Story #4:** When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the #editor element, the text is rendered as HTML in the #preview element as I type (HINT: You don't need to parse Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked).

**User Story #5:** When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.

**User Story #6:** When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the #editor field should be rendered as HTML in the #preview element.

**Optional Bonus** (you do not need to make this test pass): My markdown previewer interprets carriage returns and renders them as br (line break) elements.

### Useful resources

<!-- - [React With TypeScript Best Practices](https://www.sitepoint.com/react-with-typescript-best-practices/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand using react and typeScript. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [React with TypeScript cheatsheet](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react) - This helped me for using react and typescript. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward. -->
